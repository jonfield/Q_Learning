#Dependencies

#Usage

Run python Learner.py in terminal to see the bot open in the world.py window.
It takes about 2:45 for the bot to find a string of success.
It takes about 4:50-5:00 before the bot consistent hits its observed top score (1.48).
At the 5 minute mark, the bot still tests out different routes in the third quadrant, although not affecting the final score.
